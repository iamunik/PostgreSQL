# PostgreSQL
 A repository contains all my projects that uses postgres as its database.

### THE LIST OF PROJECTS IN THIS REPOSITORY SO FAR ARE;
- A to-do list using postgres as its database, using basic CRUD operations users are able to "CREATE a new to-do list", "READ from the database to view all tasks", "UPDATE the list", "DELETE complted tasks", viewing the to-do list was made possible with pandas.

- A billboard simulator also using postgres as its database, using basic CRUD operations users can vote for their preferred artist, and also add their artist if he is not on the list of artists in the database, a random id (primary key) is generated for each artist, and also visualisation with seaborn to get an idea of the top 10 artist even without viewing the database with pandas
